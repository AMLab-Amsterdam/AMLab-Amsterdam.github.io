The AMLAB has an open postdoc position on development of AI methods for accelerating computational fluid mechanics. You will be working with [Jan-Willem van de Meent](people/JanWillemVanDeMeent) and [Federico Toschi](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/federico-toschi) and a number of other collaborators. The specific goal is to develop scalable computational methods for rarefied flows, with use cases in carbon capture (with [Carbyon](https://www.carbyon.com/)) and photolitography (with [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en)). Deadline for applications is 28 Nov, with applications reviewed as they come in.
