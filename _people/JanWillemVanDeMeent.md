    Dr. Jan-Willem van de Meent is an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at the University of Amsterdam. He directs the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/), co-directs the [Uva Bosch Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), and directs the [Amsterdam ELLIS Unit](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/). He previously held a position as an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University, where he continues to co-advise and collaborate. Prior to becoming faculty at Northeastern, he held a postdoctoral position with Frank Wood at Oxford, as well as a postdoctoral position with Chris Wiggins and Ruben Gonzalez at Columbia University. He carried out his PhD research in biophysics at Leiden and Cambridge with Wim van Saarloos and Ray Goldstein. He served as a founding co-chair of the international conference on probabilistic programming ([PROBPROG](https://probprog.cc/)) and served as a program chair for the international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics ([AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2023/)). He was the recipient of numerous grants, including an NWO Rubicon Fellowship and of an NSF CAREER award. 

    Jan-Willem van de Meentâ€™s research seeks to understand what methods in AI have the potential to generalize across diverse application domains, and how we can think compositionally about such methods. One aspect of his work focuses on methods development in generative AI, deep learning, and probabilistic programming. He also collaborates extensively in a range of application domains. In the past he has worked on problems in biophysics, neuroscience, healthcare, and robotics. His current collaborations focus on physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and materials science. The two problems he currently cares about most are uses of AI to make scientific computation more scalable, and maximizing data-efficiency of AI methods in the context of scientific domains.
