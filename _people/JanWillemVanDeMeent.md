    Jan-Willem van de Meent is an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at the University of Amsterdam, where he directs the AMLab, co-directs the UvA Bosch Delta Lab, and directs the Amsterdam ELLIS Unit.

    His research develops principled methods for generative AI and probabilistic inference, with a focus on scalable and data-efficient scientific computation. This includes scalable neural architectures for physical systems, learned surrogate models, and deep generative models for molecular and materials design. An ongoing interest is variational flow matching, a probabilistic perspective on flow-based generative models that informs principled approaches to discrete and structured data, controlled generation, and test-time conditioning. He collaborates closely with experts in physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and materials science.

    Earlier in his career he worked extensively on probabilistic programming, the design of languages and inference algorithms that allow researchers to express complex probabilistic models as programs. This led to the development of Anglican, foundational work on inference methods for universal probabilistic programs, and a textbook.

    Prior to joining the University of Amsterdam, he was an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University. He carried out his PhD research in biophysics at Leiden and Cambridge with Wim van Saarloos and Ray Goldstein, and held postdoctoral positions with Frank Wood at Oxford and with Chris Wiggins and Ruben Gonzalez at Columbia. He was a founding co-chair of the international conference on probabilistic programming (PROBPROG) and a program chair for AISTATS 2023.
