    I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab) supervised by [Erik Bekkers](https://ebekkers.github.io/) (University of Amsterdam), and co-supervised by [Rita Fioresi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/rita.fioresi/) (University of Bologna), as part of the [CaLIForNIA](https://site.unibo.it/california-msca-se/en) Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Doctoral Network. My research focuses on Geometric Deep Learning, with an emphasis on applying geometric and topological tools to advance deep learning methods, and addressing challenges in learning on graphs and other higher-order topological structures.
