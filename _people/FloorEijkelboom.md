    I am a PhD student in physics-informed generative modeling at the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLab) and Delta Lab, supervised by Jan-Willem van de Meent and Max Welling. My research focuses on integrating principles from thermodynamics and quantum mechanics to advance the development of generative models and improve their performance.
