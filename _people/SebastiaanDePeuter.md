    I am a postdoc at [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](/) (AMLab), supervised by [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) and [Frans Oliehoek](https://www.fransoliehoek.net/wp/). I did my PhD at Aalto University under the supervision of Samuel Kaski.

    I'm interested in Human-AI interaction, and specifically how AI can help human experts make better decisions. My research looks at how we can improve interactive AI systems from two angles: through better AI systems and through better models of human behavior on which these systems are built.
