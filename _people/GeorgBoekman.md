    I am a postdoc working on geometric deep learning, hosted by Erik Bekkers on a WASP postdoc scholarship. I did my PhD at Chalmers under the supervision of Fredrik Kahl.

    Two things I'm interested in are 1) making geometric deep learning methods efficient and 2) the practical and theoretical tradeoffs between learning a priori known problem symmetries from data versus constraining the learning model to respect the symmetries.
